# Implementing the Singleton Pattern

This project demonstrates the Singleton Design Pattern in Java.  
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## PROJECT STRUCTURE ::
    ---Logger.java //singleton class
    ---Main.java // Demo using singleton
    --Test.java //For verifying the singleton works properly or not

## SAMPLE OUTPUT ::

--Main.java
    In logger class
    This is first msg
    This is second msg
    It is a singleton pattern

--Test.java
    In logger class
    It is a singleton pattern
